# About me

Hello, everyone. I am a PhD student at Dalian university of technology (DUT). I received my master's degree from the same university and bachelor's degrees form china university of mining and technology. 
My research interest is 3D point cloud object tracking, which is a challenging and important task for many applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

3D point cloud object tracking aims to estimate the location and orientation of an object in a sequence of point clouds, which are sparse and noisy representations of 3D scenes captured by LiDAR sensors. To solve this problem, I have developed novel methods and techniques based on deep learning, graph neural networks, and transformer models. 
I have published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals, such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI, TPAMI, TIP, TMM, TSCVT (am a faker). 
I have also participated in some competitions and won several awards, such as the first place in the KITTI 3D tracking benchmark [^1^][1] and the second place in the Waymo Open Dataset 3D tracking challenge [^2^][2].

I am passionate about 3D vision and I enjoy exploring new ideas and solving problems. I am also eager to learn from others and collaborate with different researchers. I hope to make some contributions to the advancement of 3D vision and its applications. Thank you for your attention.
