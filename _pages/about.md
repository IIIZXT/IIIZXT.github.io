# About me

Hello, everyone. I am a PhD student at Dalian university of technology (DUT). I received my master's degree from the same university and bachelor's degrees form china university of mining and technology. 
My research interest are point cloud understanding, 3D point cloud object tracking, domain generalization, domain adaptive, which are challenging and important tasks for many applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

3D point cloud object tracking aims to estimate the location and orientation of an object in a sequence of point clouds, which are sparse and noisy representations of 3D scenes captured by LiDAR sensors. To solve this problem, I have developed novel methods and techniques based on deep learning, graph neural networks, and transformer models. 

I have published several papers in top-tier conferences and journals, such as - [ ] CVPR, - [ ] ICCV,- [ ] ECCV, - [ ] IJCAI, - [ ]AAAI, - [ ]TPAMI, - [ ]TIP, - [X] TMM.
